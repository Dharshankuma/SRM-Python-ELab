# Simon was working in a Casa Grande. 
# His superior officer ordered him to construct a new building by incorporating equilateral, scalene and isosceles triangular shapes wherever possible. 
# But he has no idea about equilateral, scalene and isosceles triangle. 
# Can you clarify his doubt by giving him the correct category of triangle based on the values of sides given by simon?

# Functional Description :
# If All the Sides are Equal then it is a Equilateral Triangle
# If two Sides are Equal then it is a Isosceles Triangle
# If no Sides are Equal then it is a Scalene Triangle
