# Long ago, an old carpenter named Geppetto carved a puppet in the shape of a boy and named it Pinocchio. 
# He wished the boy to be a real one. A fairy heard his words and fulfilled his wish. She added life to the puppet. 
# Geppetto was surprised but overjoyed. Geppetto arranged for Pinocchio to go to school. One morning as Pinocchio was going to school late.
# The Principal of the school gave the task to him to count the number of times an alphabet repeated in the given string. 
# Can you help Pinocchio to finish the task?
