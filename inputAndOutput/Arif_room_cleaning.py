# Arif planned to make a room cleaning robot for his college mini project competition.
# First he has to code program to simulate the robot movements inside the room.
# He measured the length and width of the room.
# Once the values are available, his program should compute and display the area of the room.
# Can you help Arif with a suitable logic for the code?


length = float(input())
width = float(input())
area = length * width

print(f"{area:.2f}")
